# Templated Mutagenesis 1

[![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/matsengrp/templatedmutagenesis1.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/matsengrp/templatedmutagenesis1)

This repo contains all of the code required to reproduce all the figures and tables in the conversion paper.

## How to use it

A docker image containing partis, PyMotifFinder, their dependencies, and the R packages required to run the analysis scripts is available on dockerhub, and can be obtained by running
```
docker pull jfukuyama/gcgcgc
```

The figures and other output for the paper are all generated by the SConscript file.
It requires data to be present in the folder `gcgcgc/data` and will write all the output to a folder `gcgcgc/output`.
Running the following command after pulling the image from dockerhub will deposit all the output in the directory <output-full-path>.
```
docker run --mount src=<data-full-path>,target=/gcgcgc/data,type=bind,readonly=true \
	--mount src=<output-full-path>,target=/gcgcgc/output,type=bind \
	-it jfukuyama/gcgcgc scons
```
